A game launcher losely based on the Nintendo Switch UI, but more dynamic, hence DynaLauncher.

This project was inspired by the Ninty Launcher which you can find here: https://github.com/ninstar/Ninty-Launcher

I really love the Ninty Launcher, but im a game maker studio nerd at heart and i just couldnt stop myself trying to make my own launcher, i didnt wanna just copy Ninty so i set some different goals and started from scratch with these things in mind, some of this launchers features include:

* **Playtime tracking.**
* **Dynamic wallpaper, logo and music for each game added.**
* **Integrated profile creator for making game profiles which can then be shared and imported super easily as zip files.**
* **Fully integrated Discord Rich Presence support, with lots of icons for specific games (more added every update).**
* **Partial emulator support (added in 1.1.0) for some Nintendo emulators, more to be added soon.**
* **Multiple languages supported.**

And a lot more planned, such as more emulators, more options when creating profiles like particle effects and shaders, a fully functioning eshop clone (for free apps and fangames) and a lot more, i also have plans to rewrite a bit of the code to make it better as ive improved over the last few months since i started making this, but that will come eventually.

Anyway, here are some screenshots:
